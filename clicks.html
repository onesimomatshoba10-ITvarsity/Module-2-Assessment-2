            <h3>CLICKS</h3>
            <p>Clicks is South Africa's leading health and beauty retailer, offering value for money in convenient and appealing locations. Clicks has the largest retail pharmacy chain with 717 in-store pharmacies.
             Clicks was originally conceived as a drugstore but owing to restrictive legislation in South Africa at the time Jack's pharmacy dream was only realised 35 years later. From the outset the brand commits to offering its customers value with the promise of You Pay Less at Clicks.
               Our mission is to provide accessible and affordable health and beauty products and services to our customers, with a focus on service excellence, convenience, innovation and experience.
             Clicks is a pharmacy, health and beauty retailer with 861 stores and 691 in-store pharmacies. Clicks Baby provides a range of mother and baby products, including baby hardware, accessories, health, foods, diapers and wipes and baby toiletries.
            </p>  
            <p>
                Across 70 clinics in all nine provinces, the Clicks Helping Hand Trust (HHT), through its Moms and Babies initiative, offers free immunisation and primary healthcare services for mothers whose babies are born in state hospitals and are without medical aid.
                The Clicks 'Feel Good, Pay Less' tagline has not changed in over 50 years. It is just as relevant today as it was when Jack Goldin opened the first Clicks store in Cape Town in 1968.
